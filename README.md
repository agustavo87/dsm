# Document Sources Model
## About
Model for Quill Embeds that have to be indexed and may reference to some same source. 
A Module base class is also provided to implement and model blots with diferent HTML content (e.g., headers, images, tables, figures, formulas)

## Model

It makes an imaginary two dimensional matrix where:
- one dimesion *i* represents the diferents **Sources** of a Document (DSM/DocumentSourcesModel.js)
- other dimension *j* represents the diferents **References** in the document to the same Source. (DSM/SourceReferencesModel.js)
- Each **Reference** (DSM/Referenece.js) is an interface to a **SourceBlot** (quill/blots/source.js) in Quills document. Each SourceBlot is a Quill's interface to a HTML node.
- Each Model of Sources, model certain **SourcesTypes** (DSM/SourceTypes.js). For each source type, each source
is identified by an arbitrary string **key** thant could be anything as a tipical integer ID, or some Tag (e.g., surname2020).

It keeps the *i* dimension ordered in accordance to the position of the **first** ocurrence of a Reference of such source. The first sources in appear, are ordered before the others.

## Sources Quill Modules

It is implemented as a Quill module. *Citations* is a basic module that can be easily extended 
to make more complex types of sources (images, tables, links, headers, anything that could be of interest in to be indexed). 

The implementation of *Citation* is very basic and actually it is meant to be used by the module configuration of quill.

For example:

```javascript
import {SourceTypes} from 'dsm/DSM/SourceTypes';
import Quill from 'quill'

import SourceBlot from 'dsm/quill/blots/source';
import Citations from 'dsm/quill/modules/Citations'

// Blot para referencias
Quill.register(SourceBlot);
// MÃ³dulo de citaciones
Quill.register('modules/citation', Citations);



const quillOptions = {
    placeholder: 'Make something epic..',
    theme: 'bubble',
    modules: {
        citation: {
            type: SourceTypes.CITATION_DOCUMENT,
            class: 'citation',
            handlers: {
                create: function (node, data, controller) {
                    node.setAttribute('title', data.key)
                }
            }
        }
    },
}
                    
const quill = new Quill(quillContainer, quillOptions);

// Gets the module
const citations = quill.getModule('citation');

// Ads a citation to the source identified with the 'gus2020' key, 
// in the current location of the cursor
citations.put('gus2020'); 
```
